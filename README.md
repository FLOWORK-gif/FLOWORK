# Flowork Headless API v1: Developer & Integration Guide

Welcome to the official documentation for the Flowork Headless API. This document is your primary guide for programmatically interacting with, controlling, and integrating Flowork workflows.

## Chapter 1: Introduction & API-First Philosophy

### 1.1. Welcome to the Flowork Engine

At its core, Flowork is a powerful workflow execution engine. The graphical user interface (UI) you see is just one way to interact with this engine. This API opens a direct "door" to that engine, allowing you to automate it further, integrate it with other systems, or even build your own custom interfaces.

### 1.2. API-First Philosophy

The development of this API is based on an API-First philosophy. This means that the core of Flowork is its backend, which can run independently (headless), and all its functionalities are exposed through a stable and documented API. The existing graphical UI is treated as just another API client; it has no special privileges or "backdoor" access. This approach ensures that Flowork can evolve into a true ecosystem, where a wide variety of applications and services can be built on top of it.

### 1.3. General Architecture

The communication flow with the Flowork API always follows this pattern:

1.  **Client:** This can be the Flowork UI itself, your Python script, an application like Postman, or a `curl` command from the terminal.
2.  **Local API Server:** The request from the Client is received by the `ApiServerService` running locally at `http://localhost:8989`.
3.  **Kernel & Services:** The API Server then forwards the command to the Kernel and relevant services (e.g., `PresetManagerService`, `VariableManagerService`) for execution.
4.  **Response (JSON):** The result of the execution is returned to the Client in JSON format.

## Chapter 2: Getting Started Guide

Let's make your first API call in just a few minutes.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

  * A running Flowork project on your machine.
  * All Python dependencies installed (especially `requests`).
  * A tool for making HTTP calls. Options:
      * **curl:** A command-line utility available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
      * **Postman / Insomnia:** Highly recommended GUI applications for testing more complex APIs.

### 2.2. Running the API Server

The API server is part of the Flowork application itself. To run it:

1.  **Ensure Correct Configuration:** Open the `data/settings.json` file and make sure the `webhook_enabled` value is `true`.

    ```json
    {
        "webhook_enabled": true,
        "webhook_port": 8989
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the Flowork Application:** Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  **Verify the Log:** Look at the log in the terminal. You should see a message indicating the API server has started successfully:
    `[SUCCESS] (No Logger) API server started and listening at http://0.0.0.0:8989`

    If this message appears, our "kitchen" is open and ready to take orders\!

### 2.3. Your First API Call

Now, open a **second terminal** (leave the first one running Flowork) and execute the following `curl` command to request a list of all existing presets:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/api/v1/presets
```

**Success Response:**
If everything works, the server will respond with a JSON array containing the names of your presets, like this:

```json
["TEST", "run_python"]
```

Congratulations\! You have successfully communicated with the Flowork engine via its API.

## Chapter 3: Authentication & Security (IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE)

### 3.1. API Key Concept

**IMPORTANT:** Currently, the Flowork v1 API runs without authentication. The server is designed to be accessed only from the same machine (localhost) and within a trusted network.

For future versions that might be exposed to a wider network, an API Key system will be implemented. A secret key will be required for every request to ensure that only authorized applications or users can interact with the Flowork engine.

### 3.2. How to Use an API Key (Future)

When the API Key system is active, all requests must include an `Authorization` header.

**Example Future Request:**

```bash
# EXAMPLE FOR THE FUTURE
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/api/v1/presets \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_FUTURE_API_KEY>"
```

## Chapter 5: Use Cases & Practical Scenarios

This chapter demonstrates how to combine several API calls to achieve a larger goal.

### 5.1. Scenario: Creating & Running a Preset from Scratch via API

This is the most common workflow: defining a workflow, saving it, and then running it, all without touching the UI.

**Step 1: Prepare Workflow Data in JSON Format**
Create a file on your computer, for example `new_workflow.json`, with the following content. This is a simple workflow: START -\> Show Popup.

```json
{
    "name": "Cool API Preset",
    "workflow_data": {
        "nodes": [
            {
                "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a3b-8c7d-1e2f3a4b5c6d",
                "name": "START",
                "x": 150.0,
                "y": 150.0,
                "module_id": "set_variable_module",
                "config_values": {
                    "var_note": "This workflow was created and executed entirely via API!"
                }
            },
            {
                "id": "f6e5d4c3-b2a1-4c3d-8e7f-6a5b4c3d2e1f",
                "name": "Show Output (Popup)",
                "x": 400.0,
                "y": 150.0,
                "module_id": "debug_popup_module",
                "config_values": {}
            }
        ],
        "connections": [
            {
                "id": "c1d2e3f4-a5b6-4a3b-8c7d-9f8e7d6c5b4a",
                "from": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a3b-8c7d-1e2f3a4b5c6d",
                "to": "f6e5d4c3-b2a1-4c3d-8e7f-6a5b4c3d2e1f",
                "source_port_name": null
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Save the Workflow as a New Preset**
Use `curl` to send this JSON file to the API. The `@` symbol in `curl` means "read content from file".

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8989/api/v1/presets -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @new_workflow.json
```

A successful response will confirm the preset has been created.

**Step 3: Run the Newly Created Preset**
Now, call the execution endpoint with the name of the preset we just created.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8989/api/v1/workflow/execute/Cool%20API%20Preset -d "{}"
```

If the Flowork UI is running, you will see the debug pop-up appear.

### 5.2. Scenario: Secret Variable Management

A secure way to store and use API Keys or other credentials.

**Step 1: Save the Secret Key**
We will save a variable named `MY_SECRET_KEY`.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8989/api/v1/variables/MY_SECRET_KEY -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"value\": \"abc-123-verysecret\", \"is_secret\": true}"
```

**Step 2: Verify in the Variable List**
Check the list of variables. Notice how its value is censored with `*****`.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8989/api/v1/variables
```

**Response:**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "MY_SECRET_KEY",
        "value": "*****",
        "is_secret": true
    }
]
```

## Chapter 6: Best Practices & Error Handling

Guidance for using the API efficiently and securely.

### 6.1. Understanding HTTP Status Codes

The Flowork API uses standard HTTP status codes to inform you of the outcome of a request.

  * **`200 OK`**: The request was successful and the server is providing data (e.g., `GET /presets`).
  * **`201 Created`**: The request was successful and a new resource has been created (e.g., `POST /presets`).
  * **`202 Accepted`**: The request has been received and is being processed in the background (e.g., `POST /workflow/execute`). You will need to check its status later.
  * **`400 Bad Request`**: Something is wrong with your request. Perhaps the JSON format is invalid or some data is missing.
  * **`404 Not Found`**: The resource you are targeting (e.g., a preset or variable) does not exist.
  * **`500 Internal Server Error`**: An error occurred within the Flowork engine while processing your request. Check the Flowork terminal log for details.

### 6.2. Error Message Format

If an error occurs (4xx or 5xx codes), the server will always try to provide a JSON response with the format:

```json
{
    "error": "A description of the problem that occurred here."
}
```

### 6.3. Tips & Tricks

  * **Use Postman/Insomnia:** For serious development, use tools like Postman or Insomnia. They will make testing the API much easier than using `curl`.
  * **Content-Type Header:** When sending data (body) in JSON format, always ensure you include the header `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`.
  * **URL Encoding:** If your preset or variable names contain spaces or special characters, make sure to URL encode them (e.g., a space becomes `%20`). `curl` usually does this automatically.
